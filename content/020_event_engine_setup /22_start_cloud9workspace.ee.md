## Set up the Workspace

[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop.

## Access Cloud9 in AWS Management Console 

Once you have logged into the AWS Management Console from your EventEngine team landing page, you will already have an EKS cluster and Cloud9 environment. A few additional steps are required to configure Cloud9 and install the tools as follows. Below set of instructions are also available in the **readme** link in the Event Engine Dashboard.

Click on the **Open IDE** button and you will see your pre-configured environment. 

## Lab environment
Once you have logged into the AWS Management Console from your EventEngine team landing page, you will already have an EKS cluster and Cloud9 environment. A few additional steps are required to configure Cloud9. Please follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to Cloud9 in the AWS Management console and launch the EKS IDE. It may take a few minutes to start.
* Select the gear icon in the upper right
    - Scroll down to "AWS Settings" in the "Preferences" tab.
    - Under "Credentials", disable "AWS managed temporary credentials".
    - Close the "Preferences" tab.

Copy and run this command in your terminal as it will download and run a script that will install all the utilities that we will need to complete todays workshop. 

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://ee-assets-prod-us-east-1/modules/ad831bb586fb4f77ad39569fdf52fe6d/v1/eksinit.sh . && chmod +x eksinit.sh && ./eksinit.sh ; source ~/.bash_profile
```

You can test access to your cluster by running the following command. 
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
You should then see the a similar output to the following that shows a list of your worker nodes. 

```bash
ip-192-168-103-203.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   26h   v1.20.11-eks-f17b81
ip-192-168-135-115.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   26h   v1.20.11-eks-f17b81
ip-192-168-162-61.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    <none>   26h   v1.20.11-eks-f17b81
```

You are now ready to move on to the next step!
