In this workshop we are going to focus on these main use cases:

- **East-West security**, leveraging zero-trust security approach to implement safeguards within Kubernetes environment against malware and other malicious activities
- **Egress access controls**, using DNS policy to access external resources by their fully qualified domain names (FQDN) to prevent unauthorized access to the application
- **Host micro-segmentation**, leveraging Calico policies to protect host ports and host based services for a multi-tenant environment
- **Observability**, exploring various logs and application level metrics collected by Calico through for live visualization of communication between different components in Kubernetes environment.
- **Security alerts**, leveraging Calico global alerting framework to notify security and operations teams of any security incidents or anomalous behaviors.
- **Dynamic packet capture**, collecting full payload of the flows on demand for further forensic analysis.
- **Compliance**, providing proof of security compliance to meet organizational regulatory requirements
