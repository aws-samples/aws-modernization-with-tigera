# Introduction to Tigera and Calico

Tigera is the industry leader in Kubernetes security and observability, and is also the inventor and maintainer of open-source Calico. Its newest offering, Calico Cloud, is a next-generation, Kubernetes-native cloud service that extends the declarative nature of Kubernetes to specify "security and observability as code," which ensures consistent enforcement of security policies and compliance, and provides observability and troubleshooting across multi-cluster, multi-cloud, and hybrid deployments.
